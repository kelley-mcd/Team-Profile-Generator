# Team-Profile-Generator
homework assignment that generates information about each member of the office team.


This homework assignment was to create an index.html file that organized information about a team of office members into an easy to read generator by using the command line. 

when the user is prompted for their name and inputs a string of characters, that 'name' is sent to the team generator and placed accordingly.

The same goes for the users position, ID number, emaill address, and GitHub username.

The team generator is able to hold up to 5 team employees at a time.
